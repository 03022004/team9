        <h1>What are cookies</h1>
        <p>
            A cookie is a small text file that a website deposits on the device that is used to view it, and which stores information for future reference.
        </p>
        <h1>Why do we need to use cookies</h1>
        <p>
            Without cookies, you would be treated as a new visitor every time you visited a web page by the server where that page is located. This would of course be very annoying for you, but it would also make our sites completely unusable. A cookie acts like a key: it allows us to provide you with a faster experience, remember the settings you've made in your profile, and not display the same messages over and over. <br> <br>
            You can use this page to manage your preferences regarding cookies and similar technologies that we use on our platform. Please note that the preferences set on this page apply only to our website. You can manage your preferences on our Android and iOS app separately, from the app settings. Please also note that while you are able to disable the use of cookies from your browser settings, we do not change our practices in response to a "Do Not Track" signal in the HTTP header of your browser or mobile app, due to a lack of standardization in the interpretation of this signal. <br>
